# UFW NAT MANAGER
__Zenobius Jiricek (airtonix@gmail.com)__

UFW is the commandline firewall manager for Ubuntu Server, it serves as 
a simple frontend to IPtables.

This project allows a user to simplify the process of enabling the network
address translation functionality of UFW (and thereby IPtables), without
spending the time editing the various required files.

At the moment it is only a console based menu interface, so the next 
stage will be to separate the logic out into something a pyGtk or pyQT
interface module can make use of.

# Setup 

You need python dist-utils installed before proceeding.

    sudo python ./setup.py install
    
# Usage

Assuming the installation went according to plan, usage is currently limited to 
a menu system : 

    sudo ufw-nat


# Todo : 

1. provide argparse/optionparser command line inputs
hopefully, this will let users bypass the need to navigate the menu system
1. when listing interfaces, provide their current IP address & subnetmask, 
and gateway for ipv4 and ipv6

# License

at the moment, all rights reserved until I determine a more appropriate license.
